Are you looking for someone to design modern websites with great user experience 
in mind and cares about fast, accessible, standards-compliant responsive layouts?

 If yes, I can help.

 I can Help you With

  front end development with a strong focus on transforming the various media contents  
 into  fast, accessible, responsive and attrractive document with elegant user interface..

   Creating style guides a.k.a pattern libraries for the purpose of referencing the site elements.

   Wireframing the web pages and converting them into actual site that is required.

  Some Quirks

   I cannot give support to back end development (server-scripts) even though i created and made it work.

   I’m not appropriate for animation heavy projects (using some adobe tools).

 Please do not contact me

  If you have very close deadline,   i do not rush usually, i believe being prudential not only saves time but also save you from unecessary changes after develoment, confusions and complexity.

  If you have project already, The technologies are tens of thousands in numbers and counting nowadays, so different developers use different technologies, i don’t usually dig into others project unless i’m hired to do so.

  If you are hiring for long-term projects,    I do not engage in long-term projects as it will be inconvenient to wait for requirements that may come when i’m busy.
